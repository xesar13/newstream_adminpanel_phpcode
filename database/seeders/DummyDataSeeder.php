The International Yoga Day also educates about Yoga, which started thousands of years ago in India. It is a collection of physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines that have become popular as a way of life in the modern day. When we hear the word “yoga," we think of exercises that help us stretch or keep our bodies flexible. This western-inspired, transmogrified and neo form of yoga has made us forget our ancient roots in it.

            The word “yoga" originates from the Sanskrit root verb “yuj", which means “to unite with”. Yoga is the process through which we unite with Parabraḥma and discover the reality of our true self. Thus, it is said that Yoga is the path from jīva (individual) to Śiva (Parabraḥma). To achieve this unification with the higher reality, Guru Patanjali says one must be “Ishvara pranidhāna va", i.e., the practitioner of yoga must have steadfast devotion towards the gods. Bhagwan Shiva is believed to be the first Adi Yogi, or Yogi. It was passed down to his seven disciples, and they spread it throughout the whole world. But we don’t have any records for it as in the ancient period it was written on palm leaves, which we gradually lost over centuries and millennials.'],
